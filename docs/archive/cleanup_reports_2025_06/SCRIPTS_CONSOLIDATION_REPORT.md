# Scripts Consolidation Report

## Summary
Successfully moved all scripts from `scripts/` to `data_decide/scripts/` to consolidate all scripts in one location.

## Files Moved (6 files)
1. `launch_tokenization.sh` - Production tokenization launcher
2. `monitor_progress.py` - Universal progress monitor
3. `test_tokenization.py` - Tokenization test/validation script
4. `tokenization_comparison.md` - Documentation comparing tokenizers
5. `tokenize_datasets.py` - DataDecider-integrated tokenizer
6. `tokenize_unified.py` - Unified production tokenizer

## Intentionally Deleted
As requested, these were left deleted:
- `scripts/README.md`
- `scripts/README_tokenization.md`
- `scripts/archived_scripts/` (entire directory with 3 scripts)

## Result
- All scripts now in single location: `data_decide/scripts/`
- No more top-level `scripts/` directory
- Cleaner project structure
- Easier to find all scripts in one place

## Impact
- No functional changes required
- All scripts work from new location
- Git properly tracking the moves as renames
