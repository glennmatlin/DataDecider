This is a plain text file used for testing the tokenization system.

It contains multiple paragraphs of text that should be processed as a single document when using text input format.

The tokenizer should handle this format differently from JSONL files, treating the entire file contents as one document rather than line-by-line processing.

Special characters like quotes "example", apostrophes 'test', and various symbols !@#$%^&*() should be handled correctly.

This format is useful for processing raw text data without the need for JSON structure.
